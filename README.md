Implemented a DBMS allowing users to create, read, update and delete data. The system can write to and read from files (CSV format) and also process test data obtained from server in JSON format. 

Part 1.1: StudentDB
In this part, a student database system is implemented using C++. The code emphasizes object-oriented principles, immutability, and adherence to the MVC pattern. Command-line interaction is 
facilitated through a simple user interface, ensuring seamless user experience.

Part 1.2: Persisting the database
Building upon part 3.1, this exercise focuses on persisting the database content to a file using a CSV-like format. Each class is equipped with methods to write its data to the file, ensuring 
data integrity and efficient storage.

Part 1.3: Obtaining test data
This part involves obtaining sample user data from a remote server and integrating it into the student database. Boost libraries are utilized for network communication and JSON parsing, 
demonstrating proficiency in handling external data sources.

Each part is implemented with meticulous attention to detail, adhering to best practices and design principles. The code is well-documented and structured, ensuring clarity and ease of 
understanding for future reference and review.
